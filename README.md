# grid-path-traversal

## Overview
This is a simple project I made in my free time just for fun. So, the code might not be super structured or flexible; I mainly used it to try things out and experiment.

A random grid is generated representing free spaces and obstacles. It randomly selects a starting point ```S``` and an ending point ```E``` within the grid. The main goal is to determine if it's possible to reach ```E``` from ```S``` using basic pathfinding algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Right now, the pathfinding algorithm in use is BFS, but I’ve also included DFS in the code, but it’s just commented out.

## Demo
